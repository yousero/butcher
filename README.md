# Butcher Chess Engine: Neural Network-Based Chess AI
Butcher is an open-source chess engine inspired by LC0, designed to predict the best next move using a deep neural network without Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). Unlike traditional engines, Butcher focuses on direct policy prediction through neural networks for efficient move selection.
